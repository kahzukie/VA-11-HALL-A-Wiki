                <h2>Virgilio Armandio</h2>
                <div class="page-to-left">
                    <p><b>Virgilio Armandio</b> is a former White Knight and a regular customer at <a href="VA-11_HALL-A.html">VA-11 Hall-A</a>. </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Virgilio is an overweight man with very pale skin and black, somewhat messy hair. He has green eyes and full lips. He is always seen wearing a black jacket and a white shirt with its top button undone, as well as a multi colored tie. His most prominent feature is the black question mark on his forehead. </p>
                    <p>In Virgilio's ending, he wears orange sunglasses and his hair is completely slicked back. </p>
                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>Virgilio initially presents himself as a pompous buffoon, asking for drinks in a cryptic and unclear manner and being incredibly patronising to Jill in certain situations. </p>
                    <p>This is, in fact, just a facade to draw attention away from himself, in order to have people dismiss him immediately as an idiot. In actuality, Virgilio is a brave and selfless man who came to the aid of Stella and Sei when they were in danger, despite having to kill his superior in the process and losing all credibility as a white knight. </p>
                </div>
                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <h4>Occupation as a White Knight</h4>
                <p>Virgilio used to work as a White Knight. It's likely that he recognised <a href="gillian.html">Gillian</a> because they met while Virgilio was a White Knight. One day, his superior took two girls, Stella and <a href="sei.html">Sei</a>, as a hostage when they were playing in the park. When the knight was cornered by authorities, he began to gouge Stella's eye out and kicked Sei in the chest, severely injuring her in the process. </p>
                <h4>"Curator" at the Steampunk Museum</h4>
                <p>Presumably after he left the White Knights, Virgilio needed a job. One of his friends, the director of the Steampunk Museum employed Virgilio to work there (whether or not it's as a curator is not confirmed). </p>
                <p>Virgilio claimed he "stud[ied] everything that comes and keep[s the museum] clean for the people that visit the premises." He is at odds with the owner of the museum, saying that he should "stop touching the exhibits". Afterwards, Jill is sceptical if Virgilio is the curator, and instead comments that the owner "treats [Virgilio] like a janitor or something like that," to which Virgilio replied, "Exactly!". He probably was a janitor. </p>
                <h4>Tim's Curry</h4>
                <p>Stella and Sei managed to find Virgilio and thanked him for saving them when they were kids. To show their gratitude, the girls helped Virgilio to open the curry stand he dreamt of with the help of Stella's wealth. Stella and Sei become regulars on the stand and Jill describes his curry as delicious. </p>
