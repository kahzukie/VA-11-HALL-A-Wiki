                <h2>Dorothy Haze</h2>
                <div class="page-to-left">
                    <p><b>Rebecca Dorothy Willow Graem</b> (otherwise known as <b>Dorothy Haze</b>) is a <a href="lilim.html">Lilim</a> sex worker, a close friend of <a href="jill.html">Julianne Stingray</a>, and a regular patron at <a href="VA-11_HALL-A.html">VA-11 Hall-A</a>. She is a DFC-72 class <a href="lilim.html">Lilim</a>. </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Dorothy has short, red hair, red eyes and extremely pale (almost white) skin. Her fingers are robotic in appearance, with obvious divots separating each segment. <a href="sei.html">Sei</a> commented this is because her modded hands are designed to shoot Class-5 bullets from her fingertips. </p>
                    <p>She is always seen wearing a dress with puffy sleeves and red stripes running along its otherwise white fabric. She also wears a patterned hairband in her hair and large red bow just below her neck</p>
                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>Dorothy appears to have a bubbly, joyful and somewhat flirtatious attitude. She often greets every patron politely and doesn't at any point seem overly aggressive or violent. She takes great pride in her work, often discussing it with <a href="jill.html">Jill</a> and even <a href="nicole.html">Streaming-chan</a> at one point. Her kind nature was also shown when she gave up an entire day's work to come visit Jill when she was feeling down, sleeping with her overnight in order to comfort her, all for enough money to "pay for [a] can of soda". </p>
                    <p>Despite all this, however, on some occasions she experiences bouts of depression stemming from solipsism, a fear of being the only thing in existence, causing her to seemingly "space out" and lose her otherwise cheerful demeanour. </p>

                </div>
                <p>She also demonstrates odd habits at times, as shown when <a href="alma.html">Alma</a> is describing her method of hacking into a company's database, and she immediately goes into a trance, asking Alma to do her procedures, such as "creating a backdoor in her", or "making her buffer overflow." When asked about this, she explains that Alma's choice of words was a form of innuendo for Lilim and her words/behaviour were simply a result of that fact. </p>
                <p>Like all Lilim, Dorothy was also programmed with a random character quirk. In her case, she has an irrational fear of dogs and chinchillas. When she walked into the the bar while <a href="rad.html">Rad Shiba</a> was there, her response was to switch over from her usual over the top greeting to immediate screaming. </p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>Dorothy has been a regular at VA-11 Hall-A for some time before the start of the game and typically goes to Jill for her drinks. When you first encounter her in the game it's the day after she's finished her annual paid roleplay as  <a href="ingram.html">Ingram</a>'s daughter. Overall she's in a good mood and asks Jill to serve her favorite drink. </p>
                <p>It's revealed that despite loving her guardian (that she sometimes calls mom), she doesn't like that her guardian treats Dorothy like a kid. She also fears that her guardian is using her as some sort of replacement for her <a href="anna.html">dead daughter</a>. Dorothy started living with her guardian not long after the daughter's death, and Dorothy is worried that she might make her guardian sad; fearing that she might look at Dorothy and see her guardian's daughter, which will make the guardian sad. Jill can tell Dorothy to talk to her guardian about it. </p>
