                <h2>Sei Asagiri</h2>
                <div class="page-to-left">
                    <b>Sei</b> is an -exWhite Knight, the best friend of Stella Hoshii, and a regular customer at <a href="VA-11_HALL-A.html">VA-11 Hall-A </a>.
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Whilst initially appearing quite short and feminine at a glance, Sei does, in fact, have an extremely muscular build due to her training as a White Knight. </p>
                    <p>She has short blue hair in a bob haircut with short bangs above her nose, as well as blue eyes. After escaping from the Apollo Bank, she is left with rather severe injuries and wears bandages on her arms and head. She does recover relatively quickly, as she was almost completely recovered by the time <a href="kiramiki.html">*Kira* Miki</a>'s concert took place. </p>
                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>Sei is an extremely compassionate and kind individual, who is always seen to greet strangers kindly and very rarely complains. When Stella was being attacked by a rogue white knight when they were children, she attempted to save her despite the risk it posed and is represented as brave and altruistic when telling stories about her career as a White Knight. However, she is rather absent minded and carefree, leaving her helmet at VA-11 Hall-A the first time she visits it. </p>
                    <p>Despite her bravery, however, she is not impervious to fear and was deeply traumatized by the events at the Apollo Bank, as seen with her conversation with Jill after the disaster took place. </p>
                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Sei is born in a problematic family setting, her father is an abusive alcoholic and addicted to drugs. </p>  
                </div>
                <p>Sei and Stella first met when Stella asked her father to take her to a "real kids park". The two formed a close bond and began to meet at the park regularly, until one day while they were there, a rogue White Knight took them hostage, on the run for undisclosed reasons. After being approached by the authorities, he began to gouge Stella's eye out and kicked Sei in the chest after she attempted to stop him, breaking several of her ribs and rupturing her organs, as well as knocking her out. </p>
                    <p>Afterwards, Sei briefly regained consciousness to see the White Knight on the ground, not moving, whilst <a href="virgilio.html" title="Virgilio">another</a> had her slumped over his shoulder. He put his helmet on Stella's head and the two were quickly taken to the hospital. Sei was placed into emergency care due to the severity of her injuries and only woke up after Stella began punching her leg, telling her to do so. The two of them recovered eventually, but Stella's right eye had to be removed and replaced with a prosthetic one. </p>
                    <p>In Sei's youth when her mother tried to seek help for her husband, she received a beating before the authorities could apprehend him. This deeply scarred Sei and caused her to become diffident towards most people for a period of time. Later in her life, Sei had a drastic change of personality going from being unassuming and even violent to being kind and friendly to everyone. She decided to become a White Knight in order to help people in need. </p>
                    p
                    During the events of the game, Sei was trapped for 3 days in the Apollo Bank without food or water. Escaping caused her severe injuries and after that, she quit the White Knights and started working as a bodyguard.
